## Unified Parameter and Topic Handling for ROS
When working with ROS and Parameters, there are a couple of tools to help you with handing Parameters to your nodes and to modify them, e.g. [Parameter Server](http://wiki.ros.org/Parameter%20Server) and [dynamic_reconfigure](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamic_reconfigure/).

But with the multitude of options on where to specify your parameters and how to configure your publishers and subscribers, we often face the problem that we get a redundancy in our code and config files.

The `rosparam_handler` let's you:
- specify all of your parameters in a single file
- automatically create publishers and subscribers
- use a generated struct to hold your parameters
- use member method for grabbing the parameters from the parameter server
- use member method for updating them from dynamic_reconfigure.
- make your parameters configurable with a single flag.
- set default, min and max values
- choose between global and private namespace
- save a lot of time on specifying your parameters in several places.
- ...in both C++ and Python
